This Python script implements a simple Higher Lower game where the user needs to guess which of two randomly selected entities has a higher number of followers on social media.

## Game Mechanics

1. Two entities are randomly selected from the provided data.
2. The user is presented with the names, descriptions, and follower counts of both entities.
3. The user is prompted to guess which entity has a higher number of followers by typing 'A' or 'B'.
4. If the user's guess is correct, the score increases by 1, and a new round begins. If the guess is incorrect, the game ends.
5. The user's current score is displayed after each correct guess.

2. Clone this repository to your local machine.
3. Run the script `game.py`.
4. Follow the instructions in the terminal to play the game.

## Files

- `game.py`: The main Python script containing the game logic.
- `game_data.py`: A Python file containing the data of various entities with their follower counts, descriptions, and countries.
